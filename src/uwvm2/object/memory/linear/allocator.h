    ///          - Thread A acquires a cache line with an atomic operation.
    ///          - Thread B contends on the same cache line with another atomic.
    ///          - Thread C performs memory.grow, which relocates the buffer and stalls while copying the very cache line.
    ///          - After A releases the line, B and C race; if C proceeds first and copies “old” data into the new buffer, then B writes to the old buffer,
    ///            yielding divergence between the new buffer and reality.
    ///
    ///          Therefore, the grow_flag must be set during the grow phase to prevent new threads from attempting to read or write memory. Reference counting
    ///          is performed for instructions currently being read or written. When the reference count reaches zero, the grow process begins.
    ///
    /// @note    Usage example for memory operations:

    ///              memory_operation_guard_t guard{this->growing_flag_p, this->active_ops_p};

    ///             2. memory_operation_guard_t: Used by memory operations (read/write) to safely enter/exit
    ///
    ///             The combination ensures:

    ///             - No grow can start while memory operations are active
