# Development Status & Roadmap

## Project Overview

Ultimate WebAssembly Virtual Machine 2 (uwvm2) is a ground-up rearchitecture of the WebAssembly virtual machine, built with Concept-Oriented Programming (COP) principles to provide extensible, specification-driven, and memory-safe WebAssembly execution capabilities.

## Current Development Status

### âœ… Completed Components

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The foundational command-line program for `uwvm` has been established, providing essential interaction capabilities including version information, help system, and WASI mount root functionality.

- **WebAssembly 1.0 Parser**: A parser compliant with the WebAssembly 1.0 specification has been implemented, ensuring accurate interpretation of Wasm binaries with comprehensive section processing.

- **Section Details Processing**: Comprehensive handling of WebAssembly module sections, including type, import, function, table, memory, global, export, start, element, code, and data sections, has been achieved.

### ðŸ”„ Currently In Progress

- **WASI Preview 1 (WASI P1) Support**: Implementation of standardized system interface capabilities for WebAssembly applications, including file system operations, process management, and system calls.

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Development Phases

The following components are planned for implementation in the upcoming development cycles:

- **Local Function Module Handling**: Implementing the processing of locally defined functions within modules to facilitate modular and maintainable code structures.

- **WebAssembly Module Initialization and Validation**: Developing mechanisms for module initialization and validation to ensure compliance with the WebAssembly specification and security requirements.

- **Non-Image Compiler Concepts**: Exploring advanced virtual machine concepts such as virtual threads and tiered compilation algorithms to enhance performance and scalability.

- **High-Performance Interpreter (INT)**: Designing and implementing an efficient interpreter to execute WebAssembly code with optimized performance, serving as the baseline execution engine.

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation with LLVM**: Integrating LLVM-based JIT compilation to dynamically translate WebAssembly code into native machine code at runtime, improving execution speed.

- **INT Optable and JIT Code Caching**: Developing a caching mechanism for JIT-compiled code to reduce compilation overhead and enhance runtime efficiency.

## Release Preparation Cycle

Following the completion of the development phases, the project will enter a **Change Freeze Window**, during which:

- No new features will be added
- Focus will be on stabilization and refinement of the existing codebase
- Comprehensive testing will be conducted, including:
  - Running against WebAssembly 1.0 test suites
  - Fuzzing validation to identify and address potential issues
  - Performance and security audits

Upon successful completion of these validation phases, the `uwvm2` project is planned for release, marking its readiness for production use.

## Development Approach

The project follows a phased development cycle with iterative validation, ensuring each component meets specification compliance and performance requirements before proceeding to subsequent phases. The architecture is designed to be:

- **Extensible**: New capabilities are introduced through concept specialization
- **Specification-conformant**: Direct mapping to WebAssembly specifications
- **Memory-safe**: Comprehensive safety annotations and bounds checking
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and modular boundaries

## Technical Architecture

The project is built around several key architectural principles:

- **Concept-Oriented Programming (COP)**: Core concepts define the system's extensibility
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between parser, execution engine, and system interfaces
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Over 100 triplet platforms including DOS, POSIX, Windows, and Host C Library Series
- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Support for interpretation (INT), just-in-time compilation (JIT), and tiered compilation (TC)

## Quality Assurance

The development process emphasizes:

- **Memory Safety**: Explicit invariants, pre/post-conditions, and bounds checks
- **Specification Compliance**: Direct alignment with WebAssembly standards
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and fuzzing
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous profiling and optimization of critical paths
